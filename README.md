## Assignment

You are asked to build a simple time-spent logging system from scratch, with following specifications.

### Specifications

#### Users

* [ ] A user can login with a valid username and password through a login screen
* [ ] A user can add some time-spent information in a form
* [ ] A user can get an overview of all time he has spent by projects


#### Time entries

* [ ] A time spent record had a title and a description
* [ ] A time spent record is related to a project
* [ ] We should be able to see time spent per project


#### Projects

* [ ] A user can add a project

### Nice to have

If you are a incredible dev (we know you are), here is some optional specs that can be added.

* [ ] Input validation on the login form.
* [ ] Input validation on the timing form.
* [ ] Ability to edit/remove records
* [ ] A user with admin role that can add/remove users
* [ ] Ability to start a timer and track time with it
* [ ] Whatever you find revelant ;)

## FAQ

* The duration of the test is 4 hours
* You just have to input time spent information, you don't have to track the time
* Graphic design is not important here, the most important is the functionalities
* You can use the framework, library or plugin you're the more comfortable with
* Make sure the application works out-of-the box once you are done
* We believe a good code is self documented, but a short documentation explaining the how to launch the app or other any useful points to mention is appreciated
* Done is better than perfect
* If everything is not finished, do not worry, what is interesting to us is the path you took (that will be discussed after the test)
