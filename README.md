* You are not here to do some graphic design, it can be ugly, it has only to be functional
* You can add any framework, library or plugin you'd like
* DO wathever you want, that is exactly what we are looking for
* Make sure the application works out-of-the box once you are done
* Add a short description on how to setup and run your program in the Setup section above (have in mind that we do not have anything on our computers)
* Check the finished features in the `Specifications` and `Nice to have` section by putting an 'X' ([X]) in between the brackets
